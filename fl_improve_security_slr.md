## üìÑ Abstract

Cloud computing has fundamentally transformed data storage, processing, and access. However, as cloud environments continue to grow in size and complexity, they bring about significant security challenges. One of the critical concerns is maintaining the privacy and security of sensitive data, especially during collaborative machine learning tasks.

Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized approach that enables multiple entities to jointly train machine learning models without the need to share raw data, has emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate security risks in cloud computing.

This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) focused on Federated Learning‚Äôs potential to enhance security within cloud-based systems. The review analyzes existing studies to uncover key techniques, algorithms, and methodologies that utilize FL to improve data privacy, model security, and defend against adversarial threats.

Utilizing the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework, the literature is evaluated for quality and relevance from reputable academic sources like IEEE Xplore, Wiley Library, and ACM Digital Library.

The findings demonstrate the considerable promise of Federated Learning in addressing critical security challenges such as data breaches, model poisoning, and unauthorized access, while also safeguarding data privacy in distributed cloud infrastructures. The paper further explores the challenges and future research directions for the practical adoption of FL in cloud security applications.

## üìÑ Abstract

Federated Learning (FL) is emerging as a pivotal approach in secure distributed machine learning, especially in cloud environments where data privacy and decentralized computation are critical. As digital systems scale and diversify, cloud infrastructures face increasing challenges related to privacy breaches, data leakage, and communication bottlenecks.

Traditional centralized models often compromise sensitive data by aggregating it in one location, exposing it to vulnerabilities. FL addresses this issue by enabling local training without sharing raw data; however, it still encounters problems such as communication overhead, heterogeneity, and security threats like poisoning attacks.

This study aims to systematically review the integration of FL with cloud computing to enhance security, privacy preservation, and robustness. The objective is to identify current techniques, applications, limitations, and future trends in FL-enabled cloud systems. A PRISMA-based SLR methodology is applied to screen and analyze 100+ peer-reviewed studies from trusted repositories.

Research questions guide the extraction of key information on FL models, privacy-preserving techniques, cloud security applications, and ongoing challenges. Findings reveal that Differential Privacy, Homomorphic Encryption, and Secure Multi-Party Computation are widely adopted. Domains like healthcare, IoT, and smart grids show high operationalization of FL, while model robustness and communication efficiency remain key concerns.

The study concludes that while FL significantly strengthens cloud security, future research must address scalability, attack resilience, and personalization to fully harness its potential.

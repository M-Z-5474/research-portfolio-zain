## üìÑ Abstract

The increasing prevalence of mental health disorders underscores the urgent need for accurate and timely prediction methods. This study conducts a comparative experimental analysis of structured survey data and unstructured social media posts to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting mental health conditions using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques.

We utilize the Kaggle Mental Health in Tech Survey and Reddit mental health posts, applying machine learning models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost, Na√Øve Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Data preprocessing includes text cleaning, feature encoding, and class balancing using techniques like SMOTE and TF-IDF.

Results demonstrate that unstructured Reddit data captures real-time emotional expressions with high sensitivity, while structured survey data provides more contextual specificity. The findings highlight the complementary strengths of both data types and support the development of hybrid, AI-driven frameworks for early and ethically responsible mental health prediction.

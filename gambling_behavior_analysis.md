## üìÑ Abstract

Gambling addiction is an emerging behavioral disorder that affects cognitive control and decision-making. This study aims to explore the neural mechanisms underlying gambling-related impulsivity and reward sensitivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To identify brain regions associated with high-risk decision-making, we examined the functional connectivity between key Brodmann areas during simulated gambling tasks.

First, individual- and group-level fMRI analyses were performed to extract activation differences and impulsivity markers. Next, we employed a combination of deep learning via Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and classical models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Ridge Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify individuals based on their neural activation patterns.

Among these, Random Forest and Decision Tree achieved the highest prediction AUC (0.97), indicating strong predictive power in detecting high-risk profiles. These results support the role of brain-based biomarkers in predicting gambling disorder risk. Furthermore, our findings contribute to the development of AI-driven solutions for real-time behavioral regulation and personalized intervention in individuals vulnerable to gambling addiction.
